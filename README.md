# Stepframe Programming Style Guide

* [JavaScript Style Guide](javascript)

###Goal
*"We want to eventually be writing with one voice. We want all of the software that we develop on a project to look as though it was written by the same person, and that person is really smart and really talented. We want everything to look like that. We don't want anybody dumbing it down."* -&nbsp;Douglas&nbsp;Crockford

####Crockford talks about two types of time spent in writing programs:
- The time it takes to write the code.
- The time it takes to make the code work right.

People say things like "we just want to get this thing done quickly...so just write it sloppy, write it fast." But it turns out that if you write it sloppy it will take more of the second kind of time. _Having a style guide in place will help us to avoid the second kind of time. It will help us to **"always take the time to code well."**_

####Brendan Eich (the creator of JavaScript) talks a lot about "Foot Guns"
- A Foot Gun is a feature that you use to shoot yourself in the foot, and he admits that he put a lot of those into JavaScript.
- "*Just because a foot gun is in the language, doesn't necessarily mean you want to be shooting your foot off."*
- Because there are so many foot guns in JavaScript, you have to program with a lot of discipline.
- The same principle applies to Sass. Just because we can nest selectors endlessly, doesn't mean we should.

#####A parting quote:
*"A good writer will slavishly conform to the elements of style and express his creativity in his words, in his structures, in his images. You don't need to be messing with punctuation in order to prove you are creative."*
-&nbsp;Douglas&nbsp;Crockford
